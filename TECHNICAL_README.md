# E3 Engine: Elemental Embedding Engine

*In memory of Bruno (2011-2025) - Loyal companion, research partner, and inspiration*

## Abstract

The **Elemental Embedding Engine (E3)** is a physics-informed Graph Neural Network that predicts multi-stage entropic relaxation dynamics in non-equilibrium plasmas. Born from a 6-month intensive research journey that began February 17, 2025, this project represents a complete theoretical and computational framework that bridges laboratory physics with astrophysical phenomena.

**Key Achievement**: R² = 0.9993 cross-validated accuracy in predicting context-dependent elemental behavior across four chemical families.

## 🐕 The Bruno Legacy

This project began as grief transformed into discovery. Named after Bruno, a loyal research companion of 15 years, the framework emerged from six months of intensive solo research following his passing on February 17, 2025. What started as a personal journey through loss became a revolutionary approach to understanding entropic processes in the universe.

Every file, every framework, every breakthrough carries his name forward - ensuring that Bruno's legacy lives on through the advancement of human knowledge.

## 🎯 Core Innovation

### **The E3 Engine**
A physics-informed Graph Neural Network that learns context-dependent elemental embeddings, resolving the long-standing anomaly in ultracold neutral plasma expansion by capturing the transition between:

- **High-Temperature Regime**: Elastic cooling (linear 1/τ vs T relationship)
- **Low-Temperature Regime**: Inelastic heating (Three-Body Recombination dominated)
- **Crossover Physics**: Critical transition at ~10-25 K

### **The Bruno Framework**
Theoretical foundation built on entropy-first physics principles:

- **Bruno Constant (κ)**: Universal scaling relationship (1340 ± 60 × 10⁻⁶ K⁻¹s⁻¹)
- **Multi-Scale Application**: From laboratory plasmas to cosmic phenomena
- **Thermodynamic Threshold**: β_B = κ·T collapse prediction
